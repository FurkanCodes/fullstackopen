Store the state of the filter in the redux store. 
It is recommended to create a new reducer,
 action creators, and a combined reducer 
 for the store using the combineReducers function.

Create a new Filter component for displaying the filter. 
You can use the following code as a template for the component:

const Filter = () => {
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    // input-field value is in variable event.target.value
  }
  const style = {
    marginBottom: 10
  }

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      filter <input onChange={handleChange} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Filter
